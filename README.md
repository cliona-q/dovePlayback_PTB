# dovePlayback_PTB

A collection of files used in Dove Lab playback experiments, which
are written to run in Octave using Psychtoolbox (http://psychtoolbox.org/).

Our set-up works at 120 frames per second; relative timing of video frames
and audio onset was measured using self-made Teensy-based hardware, and
the measured offset was corrected in the scripts. This should be tested
again after any software updates!
